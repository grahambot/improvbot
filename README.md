Improvbot, the improvising computer program

About
----------

Improvbot is a piece of software I designed and programmed that improvises music in real time with a human performer. The human performer plays at a MIDI keyboard, and Improvbot improvises a solo melodic line (i.e., an oboe). Since this happens in real time, it allows for the human and the computer to react to each other as they perform together, creating a true group improvisation.
